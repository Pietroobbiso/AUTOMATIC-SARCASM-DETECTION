# AUTOMATIC-SARCASM-DETECTION

## Problem Description
Recently, much attention is being paid to the identification of sarcastic posts on social media, particularly because sarcastic comments in the form of tweets frequently contain positive words that reflect negative or undesirable features. More important now than ever is indeed the need of a device that can recognize sarcasm automatically and effectively. This paper presents a Machine Learning Approach for the detection of sarcasm sentences in news websites. The above described task was treated as a binary classification problem
and a series of ML classifiers were chosen as candidate models. Performances of the latter were successively analyzed and compared using accuracy scores and F1-measures.
